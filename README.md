Game Swap is project of internet portal for exchanging games.
I have started this project in purpose to test my react skills after I learned its basics.
I was starting without any knowledge about back-end technologies but when project was getting bigger i needed backend. I chose express.js. This React and Express code may be a mess because it's my first that big project, But i'm happy with result for now:
